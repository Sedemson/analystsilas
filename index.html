								<p>This Power BI project seeks to provide job applicants with insights into various relevant resume attributes  <br>
									that impacts job callbacks through a comprehensive data analysis. <br>
									 However, even though the dataset for this project was an old one and does not fully represent entirely <br>
									 what the case may be today in 2024 globally the main aim for this  project is to explored the correlation  <br>
									 between different attributes and likelihood of receiving a job callback and provides applicants with the tools <br>
									of idenifying trends which will improve their sucess of securing jobs. <br>
									This  project also seek to promote transparency in the hiring process and empower job applicants to focus on enhancing relevant skills 
									and qualifications to increase their chances of sucess in the job market.<br>
									Through the use of Power BI imteractive visuals and insightful analysis,this project provides valuable insight into resume <br>
									attributes that truely matters in securing job opportunities. For instance, attributes such as race and gender have no significant 
								     impact on job callbacks. <br>  However job applicants with some computer and special skills,have 4-6 years experience in the field they <br>
									 are applying for, and completed collegue education had significant contributions to job callbacks. <br>
									 Also the study found out that the overall quality of resume is the main attribute that contributed to major job callbacks.

					                  Project   <a href="https://github.com/Sedemson/githubsilas" class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></a></a></h2>
									<p>For this project, i acted as the BI consultant for Plato's Pizza Restaurant where i analysed  
										the data they collected over three years  to provide insights into the sales performance of the restaurant. <br />
										Acting as the BI consultant I analyzed various aspects of the sales data and sought to identify trends, 
										make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the performance of Plato's Pizza. <br />
										The primary source of the  data used for this analysis is the "Data Model - Pizza Sales.xlsx" file from Kaggle 
										which contains detailed information about sales made by Plato's Pizza. <br /> 
										The tools I used for this project are Excel ( Data cleaning) MYSQL( Data Analysis) 
										PowerBI (Creating Reports for the project)

										<h2><a href="#"> Data Cleaning And Visualisation Project <br />
											With Excel
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic15.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The primary goal of the project was to create a streamlined, coherent dataset 
										that could be easily analyzed and visualized.<br />
										I began the project by  Correcting typos, misspellings, and ambiguous words and 
										Standardising format for price and other essential information.<br />
										I also checked to remove all duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.<br />
										With a deeper knowledge of data cleaning techniques, <br />
										I delved into the intricate details of the Excel spreadsheet, Excel functions, 
										data validation rules, and VBA to address all anomalies and discrepancies. <br />
										This  project also made use of visualization tools such as charts and graphs which <br />
										played a pivotal role in uncovering patterns, outliers, and opportunities for improvement</p>

											Excel and Power BI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, I used a vast dataset sourced from  Kaggle documenting an array of loans. <br />
										The primary goal of the Loan Analysis Project was to clean and refine the raw data using Excel 
										and to craft visually compelling dashboards using Power BI.<br />
										 This dual-pronged approach aimed to provide a comprehensive 
										 view of loan performance, delving into factors like repayment trends, risk assessment,
										  and borrower demographics.<br />

										<h2><a href="#">Data Cleaning and Exploration Project <br />with SQL
									   </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, I used data meticulously curated from Forbes annual rankings of the highest-earning athletes.<br />
										 This vast dataset spans over two decades, offering a panoramic view of the evolving landscape of sports and its
										  financial dimensions.<br /> However, buried within the numbers were inconsistencies, missing values, and nuances that
										   required adept data management to reveal the true narratives of these athletic titans. <br />
										   The overall goal of the Forbes Athlete Earnings Analysis project was to dissect and understand the financial 
										   journeys of athletes over time. <br />The project was divided into two main stages. The first stage was cleaning the 
										   data using MYSQL to address missing or inconsistent data entries, setting appropriate constraints 
										   and standardizing formats for earnings, currencies, and athlete names.<br /> The second stage was using SQL for EDA. </p>

									<p>My passion for f research began when I was retained by my department as a research assistant. <br />
										During this time I have engaged in a diverse array of research endeavours, spanning from the field of business 
										to Artificial Intelligence and beyond.<br /> This project showcases my ability to utilise and collect data by designing
										 Google forms tailored to the research questions at hand and also cleaning and preparing the data collected by 
										 using SPSS to address outliers and missing values and ensure data integrity. <br />
										 The project also showcases my ability to utilise SPSS's visualization tools to create impactful graphs and
										  charts, presenting findings in a visually compelling manner. </p>
